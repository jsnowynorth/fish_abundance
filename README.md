# Fish habitat restoration to promote adaptation: resilience of sport fish in lakes of the Upper Midwest

Our objectives are to:
1. Develop a statistical framework to jointly model relative abundance of multiple species of fish at multiple life stages,
2. Quantify relationships between environmental conditions, species interactions, and the abundance and recruitment of managed sport fish,
3. Predict abundance and recruitment of multiple fish species under future scenarios of climate change,
4. Identify and communicate priority lakes for implementing habitat protection and restoration actions that can reduce the vulnerability of lakes to loss of sport fish populations under future climate conditions.
